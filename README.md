# break-timers
Light-weight timers to remind you to take regular breaks from your work

## Work Timers
These scripts are to provide light-weight timers/reminders to get you to take breaks from your work regularly, for your mental clarity / productivity and your health.

They are written in VBS so you don't need to install any application to use them.

## Origin
pomodoro.vbs was cloned from https://github.com/iaarnio/pomodoro-timer
It has since been updated to add missing features.
e.g. in the original it was possible to accidentally start multiple overlapping pomodoro timers.
This version has locking implemented to prevent this.

### Requirements

Written in vbscript, so will probably only work on Windows platform... (write a better one for Linux/Mac!)
